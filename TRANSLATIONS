There are three sections:
A) New translations
B) Updating existing translations
C) Testing a translation

Follow the steps designated in each section to modify or
test your translation.


A) New Translations
-------------------------------------------

1) Execute these commands:
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ cd po
	$ make monsoon.pot

2) A file called monsoon.pot has now been created in the po
   directory. Rename this file to $LANG$.po. For example,
   if you were translating german you would call it 'de.po'.

3) Open this file in your favourite text editor and fill in
   the required translations.

4) Edit configure.in and go to line 55 and include your
   translation in the list of languages. If you were
   including 'de.po' you would make the following modification.

-ALL_LINGUAS="es fr"
+ALL_LINGUAS="es fr de"

5) When you're finished, run 'svn diff' and save the output.
   Send that in as your translation.


B) Updating an existing translation
-------------------------------------------

To update an existing translation, you need to do the following:

1) Execute the following commands:
	$ svn up
	$ cd po
	$ make update-po

2) Open the required language file in your text editor and search
   for "fuzzy" or "". These are places which need to be updated.

3) When complete run the following command and submit the
   'language.patch' file. Replace $LANG$ with the language
   you are translating. For German, this would be 'de'.

$ svn diff $LANG$.po > langauge.patch
